                    <h3>6. Results and Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The iterative development and refinement throughout both phases led to significant improvements in the AGV's performance. The robot demonstrated enhanced accuracy in line tracking, smoother navigation around complex turns, and increased reliability in various test environments. The optimized control algorithms resulted in more efficient power consumption and a more stable trajectory. The AGV successfully met the objectives of staying on track and adapting to different line configurations, proving its potential for practical applications. The implementation of robust error correction and intersection handling further solidified its capabilities for real-world deployment.</p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>The microcontroller-based line follower AGV, developed through a two-phase project, stands as a robust and effective autonomous system capable of recognizing and precisely following its designated path. The initial phase established the foundational design and basic functionality, while the second phase focused on critical refinements in circuit design, sensor calibration, and algorithm optimization. These enhancements significantly improved the robot's ability to maintain its track, adapt to varying environmental conditions, and navigate complex line patterns with greater precision and reliability. This project not only provided a practical solution for automated transport and logistics but also profoundly deepened our collective understanding of integrating diverse engineering disciplines—electronics, mechanical systems, and programming—to create sophisticated and functional robotic applications. The challenges encountered fostered cooperation, communication, and problem-solving skills within the team, culminating in a successful prototype.</p>
