Microcontroller Based Line Follower AGV Using Arduino

This repository contains the project report presented as a web-based site, structured by logical sections of the project. This project was carried out as part of our academic curriculum at Bangalore Institute of Technology, affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University.


Project Overview

The core of this project involves designing and implementing an autonomous line-following Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV). This AGV is engineered to navigate along a predefined path (a black line on a contrasting surface) using infrared sensors, an Arduino Uno microcontroller, and DC motors. The project addresses the need for efficient and reliable automated transport solutions in industrial and logistical settings, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce human intervention.


Features

Autonomous Navigation: The AGV can autonomously follow a black line.

Microcontroller Based: Utilizes Arduino Uno for intelligent control.

IR Sensor Array: Employs IR sensors for accurate line detection.

Motor Control: Implements an L293D motor driver for precise motor control.

Section-Based Multi-Page Website: Presents the project report content organized into distinct logical sections (Introduction, Methodology, Working Principle, Applications, Results & Conclusion, References) across separate web pages.Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
