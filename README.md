Microcontroller Based Line Follower AGV Using Arduino

This repository contains the project report presented as a web-based site, structured by logical sections of the project. This project was carried out as part of our academic curriculum at Bangalore Institute of Technology, affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University.Project OverviewThe core of this project involves designing and implementing an autonomous line-following Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV). This AGV is engineered to navigate along a predefined path (a black line on a contrasting surface) using infrared sensors, an Arduino Uno microcontroller, and DC motors. The project addresses the need for automated transport solutions in industrial and logistical settings, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce human intervention.FeaturesAutonomous Navigation: The AGV can autonomously follow a black line.Microcontroller Based: Utilizes Arduino Uno for intelligent control.IR Sensor Array: Employs IR sensors for accurate line detection.Motor Control: Implements an L293D motor driver for precise motor control.Section-Based Multi-Page Website: Presents the project report content organized into distinct logical sections (Introduction, Methodology, Working Principle, Applications, Results & Conclusion, References) across separate web pages.Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).Project Report SectionsThe project report is divided into the following key sections, each accessible via a dedicated page:Introduction: Covers the project's background, problem definition, literature review, and objectives.Methodology: Details the components used, circuit design, and overall system flow.Working Principle: Explains the detailed operational principles of the AGV, including enhancements.Applications: Explores various real-world applications of the line-following AGV technology.Results & Conclusion: Presents the project's outcomes and the overall concluding remarks.References: Lists all the academic and technical sources cited in the report.Technologies UsedHardware:Arduino Uno MicrocontrollerL293D Motor Driver ICIR SensorsBO MotorsSoftware/Web:HTML5CSS3 (with Google Fonts - Inter)JavaScriptHow to View the Project Website LocallyClone the repository:git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
(Replace [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL] with the actual URL of your GitHub repository once you create it.)Navigate to the project directory:cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
(Replace [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME] with the name of your cloned repository, e.g., line-follower-agv)Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking it or by using your VS Code's "Open with Live Server" extension (recommended for development).Deployment on GitHub PagesYou can easily deploy this website using GitHub Pages:Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., line-follower-agv).Initialize a local Git repository in your project folder (where index.html, introduction.html, methodology.html, etc., and styles.css, script.js are located).git init
Add your files:git add .
Commit your changes:git commit -m "Initial section-based multi-page project website commit"
Link your local repository to your GitHub repository:git remote add origin [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
Push your code to GitHub:git push -u origin master
(If your default branch is main, use git push -u origin main instead.)Enable GitHub Pages:Go to your repository on GitHub.Click on "Settings".In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch".Choose your branch (usually main or master) and the /root folder.Click "Save".Your website should now be live at https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]/.ContributorsUDAY KUMAR DL (1BI18ME146)VINAY KUMAR P (1BI18ME152)VITTAL M GOREBAL (1BI18ME157)YASHWANTH GOWDA (1BI18ME158)GuidancePhase 1 Guide: Mrs. SAHANA REDDY, Asst.
